== Static site editor elements

SSE (Static Site Editor) aims to simplify the creation of cross-platform
user-friendly GUIs for editing static websites with Electron,
and provides an assortment of tools to that effect.

SSE is based on React and Typescript. Its UI widgets build upon Blueprint 3,
and it uses Isomorphic Git to provide collaboration tools.

At its current (fairly early) stage it consists of following components:

* `settings`: Manipulate application settings exposed to the user in some way
* `localizer`: Work with data that is translatable in multiple languages
* `storage`: Manipulate structured data, e.g. Jekyll posts or such, and synchronize it with upstream using VCS.
  Currently supports YAML and Git
* `preflight`: Check data for problems, which may help identify issues that would break site build
* `spotlight`: Look up objects in the database
* `api`: Offers tools for communication between Electron main and renderer processes through API endpoints
* `main/window`: Offers tools for Electron window manipulation
* `renderer/widgets`: Offers a set of Blueprint 3-based widgets
